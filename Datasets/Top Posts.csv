2,"Megathread: Trump Indicted on Third Set of Charges, This Time Related to the January 6th Attack and Associated Efforts to Overturn the 2020 Presidential Election","On Tuesday, former president and current frontrunner for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination Donald Trump was indicted by a federal grand jury in Washington, D.C. [Source: Associated Press](<https://apnews.com/article/trump-indicted-jan-6-investigation-special-counsel-debb59bb7a4d9f93f7e2dace01feccdc>). The charges include: Conspiracy to Defraud the United States, Conspiracy to Obstruct an Official Proceeding, Obstruction of and Attempt to Obstruct an Official Proceeding, and Conspiracy Against Rights. [You can read the full indictment for yourself here at CourtListener.](<https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.258149/gov.uscourts.dcd.258149.1.0_1.pdf>) These charges stem from one of two separate investigations into Trump being conducted by Special Counsel Jack Smith for the US Department of Justice. The first investigation is into the apparent mishandling of highly classified documents after Trump had departed office. This resulted in [37 felony charges](<https://www.npr.org/2023/06/09/1181340894/trump-indictment-classified-documents-charges>) being made public on June 9th of this year, with [3 additional, related charges](<https://www.npr.org/2023/07/29/1190953438/trump-faces-new-charges-in-classified-documents-case>) added last week. Today's charges stem from the second investigation headed by Smith, which is into the January 6th, 2021 attack on the US Capitol and associated efforts within the Trump Administration to illegally overturn Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 presidential election. The aforementioned investigations into Trump are a separate matter from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's inquiry, which in April resulted in an indictment on [34 counts of falsification of business records](<https://www.npr.org/2023/04/04/1167708172/trump-charges-hush-money-new-york-indictment>). According to Bragg, Trump was part of a scheme to catch and kill"" negative information about himself before and after the 2016 election via hush money payments made via the Trump Organization.  Still outstanding are the results of a fourth probe being conducted by Fani Willis, the District Attorney for Fulton County, Georgia.  That probe is into Trump and others' efforts to overturn Georgia's 2020 presidential election results; an announcement related to DA Willis' probe is [expected sometime later in August](https://apnews.com/article/trump-georgia-election-investigation-fani-willis-d6191037a8993d653686e679bf5e8ea5).

7,Megathread: Trump and Others Indicted by Fulton County DA on Charges Related to the Effort to Overturn Trump's 2020 Loss in Georgia,"Today a Fulton County, Georgia grand jury indicted Donald Trump on numerous charges including racketeering, conspiracy and false statements. Also indicted were several other individuals, including but not limited to: Rudy Giuliani; Misty Hampton, Coffee County elections supervisor; David Shafer, chairman of the Georgia Republican Party. 

Specifically cited in the indictment prepared at the direction of [Fulton DA Fani Willis](<https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/14/politics/fani-willis-fulton-county-district-attorney/index.html>) was [Trump's call to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump>–Raffensperger_phone_call) in which Trump pressured Raffensperger to change the state's election results. Also cited in the indictment was the scheme to use false electors to throw Georgia's electoral votes to Trump, ([at least 8 of whom were granted immunity in Willis' investigation](<https://apnews.com/article/fulton-county-election-investigation-trump-georgia-fb5240cf854eb546b027f950646268c2))>. 

The first charge against Trump is one made under [Georgia's Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act](<https://apnews.com/article/georgia-trump-election-investigation-indictment-rico-willis-2b18a1c1ed6a4ce22b1a2ca88ea861e3>), which is significantly more expansive than its federal counterpart. Other charges against Trump include multiple counts of Solicitation of Violation of Oath by a Public Officer, Conspiracy to Commit Impersonating a Public Officer, multiple counts of Conspiracy to Commit Forgery in the First Degree, multiple counts of Conspiracy to Commit False Statements and Writings, Conspiracy to Commit Filing False Documents, Filing False Documents, and multiple counts of False Statements and Writings, all of which are felonies.
